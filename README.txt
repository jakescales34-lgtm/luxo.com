# Luxo — Bring the Light Back
This is the static site for Luxo Home Services. Upload these files to your GitHub repo and enable **GitHub Pages**.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Upload all files to your repo root (keep the `assets/` folder).
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Branch**, select `main` and **root**. Save.
4. Your site will publish at: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Edit Contact
Change phone/email in `index.html` (look for the `Get a Quick Quote` section).

## Tips
- The logo sits in `assets/logo.png`. Replace it anytime.
- Add photos in `assets/` and link them in the HTML as you grow.
